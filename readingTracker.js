// (Existing Comment) Prints a summary of minutes read per day
// * This function prints a summary of each day's reading *
// * It loops through the log and logs a formatted string for each entry *
// * Output is printed using console.log *

  for (let entry of log) { // * Log each day's reading with the book title and time *

// Example usage
addReadBook("Saturday", "Dune", 50); // *existing example*
addReadBook("Sunday", "Ender's Game", 35); // âœ… New test case for assignment
printDailySummary(readingLog); // * Output summary of all entries in the log *
console.log("Total minutes read:", totalReadingMinutes(readingLog)); // * Show total time spent reading *
console.log("Most read book:", mostReadBook(readingLog));  // * Show which book had the most entries *

// * Suggestion: Add input validation to functions like addReadBook to prevent empty or invalid data (ex: missing book name or negative minutes) 
// It would be beneficial to ensure there are no missing or errors caused by the missing or invalid data *
