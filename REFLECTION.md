## What did you learn by reviewing the JavaScript file?

- By reviewing the code, I learned how each of the functions contribute to the overall functionality of the .js file and how a organized and readable code makes it easier to maintain or edit/update. It was also also good practice to add inline comments, which helped reinforce my understanding of the code for me and anyoneelse who examines the code.

## What improvements did you suggest and why?

- I suggested adding an input validation to the `addReadBook` function. It would help prevent incorrect or invalid data (like empty titles or negative minutes)from being added or forgotten to the log. Itâ€™s a simple sugesstion that goes along way.

## What new test case did you add and why?

- The test case that I added was `addReadBook("Sunday", "Brave New World", 35)`. There was already a saturday entry being added into the code, so all I had to do was copy the logic with new entra data and ensure it would work like the saturday entry. This helped confirm that the program can accept and track new entries correctly.

## What did you notice about the original file?

- The original file already had clean and readable code and structure. But there was no inline comments, even though the functions did have a short explanation they didn't do a full deep thorough explanation that would be better for someone just beggining to understand code or someone reviewing it.
